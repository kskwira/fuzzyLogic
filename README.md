App that calculates your "Training effect" based on the basic statistics from your activity such as:
<p>Total time</p>
<p>Average Heart Rate</p>
<p>Average Running Pace</p>

It uses the Fuzzy Logic with established set of rules to provide you with the overall score (0-5). \
By default you need to adjust your age in the code as well as change the hard coded stats from the run.

The app will provide you with the final score and plot the graph representing the membership.

Idea for this App is strongly inspired by the Trademarked solution in the GARMIN running equipment.

Enjoy!
